# Workarounds

A place to write down temporary workarounds.

### Patched Packages

We sometimes use patched versions or do our own patches one exising packages and publish them to npm on `@coral-forks/*`. The way we are wiring the packages is by utilizing the `paths` option in `tsconfig.json` when using typescript and webpack. For other use cases we set `NODE_PATH` to `./node_modules/@coral-forks`. This is a fast way to help unblock us from pending PRs.

### Babel

Babel versions are currently locked to 7.0.0-beta.49 because of this bug:

### Relay

We are using a patched version of `Relay` that adds support for `Typescript`. Big thanks to [@alloy](https://github.com/alloy) for his fork on https://github.com/alloy/relay. The patched packages are published to `@coral-forks/*`.



### relay-compiler-language-typescript

We have patched [relay-compiler-language-typescript](https://github.com/relay-tools/relay-compiler-language-typescript)  with an hack to fix an issue with `--noImplicitAny` support (https://github.com/relay-tools/relay-compiler-language-typescript/issues/48). We released the package in `@coral-forks/relay-compiler-language-typescript`.
