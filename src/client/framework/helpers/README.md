# Helpers

In this folder should live helper functions that helps avoiding writing duplicate code.
Each helper should be added to its own file and the `index.ts` should aggregate the helper
functions for easy consumption.

## How does it differ from a `utils` folder

`helpers` are specific to our technology stack and product domain whereas `utils`
are technology and domain agnostic.
